## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

### What I learned

This was my first time working with fetch API in a project. While it took me a while to figure out how to do it, I finally found a solution through a YouTube video that helped me fetch data from the API. I realise that I need to practise working with APIs more.

This was also my first time using SASS. I found it pretty straightforward to use and much more efficient than vanilla CSS. I hope to use it from now on in future projects as it truly streamlined my process of styling the design!

### Continued development

The areas I intend to improve on are:
- SASS
- Fetch API
- Async JavaScript
- Try and Catch

### Useful resources

- [Oston Code Cypher's tutorial on using Advice Slip JSON API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AfzKmgqWUE&ab_channel=OstonCodeCypher) - This YouTube video helped me figure out how exactly to extract data from the API and implement it.
